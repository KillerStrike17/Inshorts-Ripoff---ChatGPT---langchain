Seven people have been arrested in connection with the gunpoint robbery of a delivery agent and his associate inside the Pragati Maidan tunnel here, police said on Tuesday. The accused robbed them of about Rs 2 lakh on Saturday when they were on their way in a taxi to Gurugram to deliver the money. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the accused carried out recces on Thursday and Friday, and were on the look out. On Saturday, they executed the robbery, a senior police officer said. CCTV camera footage received by the Delhi Police showed four motorcycle-borne men intercepted the car and robbed the delivery agent of Omiya Enterprises, Chandni Chowk, and his associate. The arrested are Usman, his cousin Irfan, Anuj Mishra, Kuldeep, Sumit, Pradeep and Bala, police said. They were following the taxi and chose to stop it inside the tunnel as they had a higher chance of success to execute the robbery. People usually do not stop in tunnels and drive through them at speed, according to police. Usman has been identified as the main conspirator and he gave information to the others, they said The 22-second footage shows the four men following the taxi on two motorcycles and intercepting it inside the tunnel as other vehicles passed by. As the taxi stopped, two men, wearing helmets, got off the motorcycles. One of them went towards the driver's side and the other to the rear door on the other side and whipped out their pistols. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The footage then showed both the car gates open and the man at the rear end being handed over a black-coloured handbag, apparently carrying money. The two then quickly hopped onto their waiting motorcycles and fled with their accomplices.

The expenses made to renovate Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's bungalow will be probed by the country's top auditor, sources said today, after a months-long controversy. The Union Home Ministry has ordered the audit following a letter from Delhi's Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena alleging gross irregularities, sources said. Denying allegations of irregularities, Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has accused the Centre of targetting political opponents. \"The order for a CAG inquiry into the expenditure in the reconstruction of the Chief Minister's residence is exposing the desperation, cynicism and dictatorship of the BJP. Frustrated by the successive electoral defeats in Delhi, the BJP is plotting not only to defame the honest government of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, but also to grab power here from behind the scenes,\" read a statement from AAP. The government, AAP added, should instead focus on the multiple scams taking place in the BJP-ruled states. Sources said the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, or CAG, will conduct the \"special audit\" into the \"administrative and financial\" irregularities in the renovation. The letter had alleged gross financial irregularities in the reconstruction of the building, located in north Delhi's Civil Lines. To start with, in the name of renovation -- usually involving just addition or alteration -- a full-fledged construction and re-construction was carried out by the Public Works Department, the LG has alleged. The PWD had not obtained sanction for the work, including demolition of a pre-existing building. It had not even ascertained ownership of the premises, sources said. The cost -- from an estimated 15-20 crore -- had gone up to Rs 53 crore, the LG had written. The BJP's Sambit Patra had earlier alleged that Mr Kejriwal's residence had been fitted with expensive marble from Vietnam, pre-fabricated wooden walls and curtains that cost lakhs of rupees each. One curtain alone cost more than Rs 7.94 lakh, he said. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com AAP had alleged that the accommodation earmarked for Mr Kejriwal was unfit to live.

The ruling party of Tamil Nadu had contended that a uniform code should first be applied to the Hindus, who will then have to allow people from all castes to pray in temples. \"Uniform Civil Code should be first introduced in the Hindu religion. Every person including Scheduled Castes and Tribes should be allowed to perform pooja in any temple in the country.

The whole state is burning. He is just distracting people from all these issues,\" he added. Pitching for the implementation of Uniform Civil Code, which has been part of BJP's election manifestos, PM Modi said today that it doesn't work to have \"different set of rules for different members of a family\" and a country can't run on two laws. If \"Triple Talaq\" is an inalienable part of Islam, why it isn't practised in Muslim-majority countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Qatar, Jordan and Syria, he questioned. Citing the example of Egypt, where he was on a visit last week, PM Modi said the country had abolished Triple Talaq 80-90 years ago, even though 90 per cent of its population comprise Sunni Muslims. Slamming the opposition, he said, \"Whoever talks in favour of Triple Talaq, whoever advocates it, those vote bank hungry people are doing a great injustice to Muslim daughters. Triple talaq doesn't just do injustice to daughters. It is beyond this; the whole family get ruined\".
